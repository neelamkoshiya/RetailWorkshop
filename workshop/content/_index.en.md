### Intro

In this workshop, we will build an end-to-end, entirely serverless solution for retail analytics, forecasting, and personalization. 

### Outcome

At the end of this workshop, without needing to spin up a single server ourselves, we will be able to do the following:

1. Ingest data (from simulated PoS systems and other sources) as transactions happen,
2. Derive near-realtime insights and detect anomalies,
3. Annotate ingested data with additional information (such as weather or other data), 
4. Store this data for long term records and historical analysis,
5. Forecast future demand based on this data, and
6. Create personalized recommendations for customers.

### Target Audience

The topics and services covered in this workshop are at Level 300 and intended for software developers and data engineers. We estimate that building this solution will take about 3 to 4 hours depending on familiarity with AWS services.
