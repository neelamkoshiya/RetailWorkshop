1. Click on 'Start' under 'Generate forecasts'

2. Enter a descriptive name against 'Forecast name' 


3. For the 'Predictor' drop-down, choose the predictor that we just trained in the previous step.


4. Click on 'Create a Forecast'

This step should take around 10 to 15mins (shorter than training the predictor). While this makes progress in the background, we can start **[Lab 2]({{< relref "lab2" >}})**.
