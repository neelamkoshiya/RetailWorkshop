The training job that we just kicked off can take a while. About 20-30 mins in our experience, so we are going to let this run and move to [Lab 1]({{< relref "lab1" >}}).

Just to recap, what we've done so far is:

1. Simulated an aggregated retail analytics dataset.
2. Copied this dataset to an S3 bucket.
3. Imported this dataset into Forecast
4. And launched a job to train a predictor on this data.

So let's move to [Lab 1]({{< relref "lab1" >}}) and pick this thread back up when the training is done.
