**A quick note before we begin**  
Outside of this workshop setting, you would have already setup infrastructure for ingestion, processing, analyzing, and storing data (essentially labs 1 and 2). And you'd have data that is readily available.<br/><br/>
But because it takes some time to train Amazon Forecast's predictors, for the purposes of this workshop, we will simulate aggregated retail analytics data and use that data to train predictors. And work on labs 1 and 2 while the training runs in the background.
