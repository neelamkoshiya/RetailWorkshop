In this lab, we will generate simulated POS data that we will ingest as it happens. We will also process this data in near real-time and detect anomalies on the fly. And finally, we will store this data, along with the generated anomaly scores and associated explanations (why a value was considered anomalous along with attribution scores that show which specific column caused it to be flagged as an anomaly) for our records and historic analysis.
