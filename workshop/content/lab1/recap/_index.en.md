To Recap everything we did in Lab 1, we: 

1. Created an Amazon Kinesis Data stream to ingest large volumes of data
2. Ran a simulation script to generate PoS data and send to Kinesis
3. Created an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application to receive data from the Kinesis Data stream and detect anomalies

Before proceeding with Lab 2, we recommend checking up on progress with Amazon Forecast predictor training that we kicked off earlier on in Lab 3. If all is well, the predictor training should either be complete or very close to completion by now.

Now, let's switch over to [Lab 3, Step E]({{% relref "lab3/console/step-e" %}}) and execute just that step so that everything's ready for us when we're ready to see forecasts as part of Lab 3.
