## [Event Engine]({{< relref "setup/event_engine" >}})

If you're here as part of a workshop event, we will use the purpose-built Event Engine to provision free AWS accounts that you can use for the duration of the workshop. 

However, if you're using your own personal (or company) AWS account, feel free to skip this step and move to Cloud9 IDE setup.

## [Create Cloud9 Environment]({{< relref "setup/cloud9_ide" >}})

Technically speaking, you don't need Cloud9 IDE. Any IDE that you feel most comfortable with and best suits your needs will do. 

But for the purposes of standardizing workshop instructions, we'll will use the Cloud9 IDE environment, which comes with popular languages (Ruby, Python, NodeJS, Java, etc.) and many associated libraries pre-installed to help save us time. 

## [Labs]({{< relref "setup/lab_order" >}})

Once you've setup your Cloud9 environment, you can start off working thru' each of the labs in this section.

We will run these labs a bit out of order since training the model that Amazon Forecast Predictor will use takes a bit of time.
