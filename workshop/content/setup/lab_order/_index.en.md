**Order of Labs**  
Given that 1. training Amazon Forecast predictors and 2. generating forecasts, each takes significant time (around 40 and 25 mins each), we're going to shuffle the order of the labs and start off with Lab 3.  
<br/>
After we kick them off, we'll just work thru' the labs in order. This will allow the time consuming steps (training of predictors and generation of forecasts) to complete in the background.  
<br/>
In a typical production scenario, the order would be: 1/ ingest 2/ process 3/ store 4/ analyze and 5/ forecast & personalize.

Open [Lab 3]({{<relref "lab3">}}) first. We've added cues after each of the two time-consuming steps in Lab 3, so you'll know when to switch back to other labs to allow the most time-consuming steps in [Lab 3]({{<relref "lab3">}}) to finish in the background.
