### Create Solution

Once the data set is imported, we can now start building a model which will be trained based on the past user interactions. 

1. First step would be to click create solution on the dashboard

2. Second step would be to name the solution - retail-solution. For the recipe pick the user personalization from the dropdown. Rest of the optional parameters we will keep it blank for this example.
