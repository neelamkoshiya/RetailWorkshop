**Cleanup**  
If you are using your own AWS account for this workshop, we'll need to clean up all the resources that we created.

{{% /notice %}}

However, if you're working thru' the labs as part of an event and you're using Event Engine, there's no other action necessary on your part. The lab environment will be automatically purged after the workshop ends.
