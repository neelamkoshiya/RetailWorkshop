Let's recap what we did. We:

1. Crated a Kinesis Data Firehose resource to store data in Amazon S3
2. Used AWS Glue to crawl data in Amazon S3 and auto-discover schema
3. Used Amazon Athena to query and gain insights into collected data

You can now jump to [Lab 3, Step F]({{% relref "lab3/console/step-f" %}}) to lookup a forecast.
